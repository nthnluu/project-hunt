# About

We would like to present Project Hunt, a solution for team-building and a platform for making amazing things happen! 

It can be difficult at times to organize a group of people with the skills necessary to start your project. Using “Project Hunt”, ANYONE can build the best team for a project. This site creates a casual atmosphere for connecting people to projects, whether it’s an actual startup or a hobby project. 

After signing up, users can post project proposals with a brief description of their project idea, approximate time commitment/ timeline, and required skill sets. (They can edit their project proposal even after it is posted) 

Now the best part of the app is: Users can easily "Hunt" for projects! All they have to do is to fill in their profile, browse through the project proposals, and send an in-app request to join a project! 

The project proposal also includes additional features such as github README API so that prospective project participants can have a better understanding of the tech aspect of the project.
