# About

Using “Project Hunt”, ANYONE can build the best team for a project.

Now the best part of the app is: Users can easily "Hunt" for projects!
All they have to do is to fill in their profile, browse through the project proposals, and send an in-app request to join a project! (Additional features such as project like included)
